# C--MINIGAME-COMPILATION

This is a compilation of games created by me (although some of them are finished through some help from friends, mentor, and internet).

It's purpose is to help me master C programming and for fun (who knows if i want to play them one day)

Please take note that all of these games are derived from real games that have been created before / from assignments from NAR 21-1

** NAR 21-1 = New Assistant Recruitment 21 - 1 , by Software Laboratory Center, Bina Nusantara University

Most programs can only run using Windows Operating System

(sorry if the style of code doesn't follow C Coding Standard, i've just figured it out after about 15 minigames and it will take too long to fix. Not to mention this is literally just for fun)
